# website-blocker
This is a website blocker built in Python for the Windows operating system. The source code and the usable .exe file are available. 

The file needs to be run as an administrator from the command line, since it requires access to the hosts file. 

The time and websites to be blocked can be changed by editing the source code in website_blocker.py

# instructions
Download the exe file and run the application as adminstrator. 

Choose the website you want blocked.

Set the time in between which you want the website blocked.
